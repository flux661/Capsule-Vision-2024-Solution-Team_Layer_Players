- The **dataset** directory contains the training data, validation data and the testing data.
- The **Capsule_vision_final_model.py** and **Capsule_vision_final_model.ipynb** files contain the code for training the **Resnet101model with Squeeze-Excitation Blocks.**
- The **Resnet101SE_result_generation_val_test.py** and **Resnet101SE_result_generation_val_test.ipynb** files contain the code for loading the trained model and generating the predictions on the validation and test datasets.
- The **Results** directory contains the final generated .xlsx files on the validation and test datasets. 
- The code used for generating the .xlsx files was provided by the organisers on their official github repository of Capsule Vision Challenge 2024.
